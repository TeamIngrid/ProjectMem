# The Story

How Memseer came to be

[Memseer](https://memseer.com) is a product of my deep desire - I want everything running smoothly but without having to remember when and what to do.

It all started years ago when I used to have a small car with an interference engine. An interference engine is an engine where the valve and piston
traverse the same space but are carefully timed so they never meet each other. The engine has a timing belt that controls the valves and if the belt breaks, 
bad things will happen. If you are lucky, a couple valves might be broken, if unlucky the engine becomes junk. So, I figured to keep a log of both mileage and 
when the all important belt needed to be replaced. Not long after, I realized there were other things that needed timely replacement — or I’d risk finding myself 
walking down the road.

Cars, as important as they are, aren’t the only thing to keep an eye on. I have UPS, and it needs to have its battery replaced every 5-6 years. Once again in the best
case the UPS doesn't function properly, in the worst, battery could burst into fire. What about air filter in HVAC system, I sure forgot about it a few times and I never 
remember which filter size to buy. Personal health, when was my last checkup? What about pets, do they need yearly shots? Did I miss house insurance renewal and what was 
the amount paid last year? Does my water filter need to be replaced? Is my treadmill track lubricated? And the list keeps going.

All those small things make an impact on our lives. The problem is: how to keep track of all those small things? One way is sticky notes, but where do I keep them? On a fridge? 
On a furnace? Next to an entrance? Do I need to regularly revisit all those stickies and make sure stuff is done? Do sticky notes sometimes get lost? And once I’m done with a 
task, if need be, do I have a history to refer to? Perhaps all the sticky notes can be organized into a binder, collected, managed and evaluated every weekend to figure out 
when and what chore needs to be done.

I tried the approach above with very limited success—and an unhealthy amount of anxiety. I still couldn’t remember which air filter size to buy once I got to the store. 
Then I thought, perhaps there’s a better way: organize my notes into a digital binder. It’s always in one place—no matter where you are! You can access it from any device, 
and your notes never get lost. The complete history is always available.

You no longer need to review all your notes every weekend to figure out what needs to be done. In fact, you don’t even have to take notes anymore—just set up the rules, 
and all your chores appear in a simple, easy-to-understand format. Now I don’t have to remember when it’s time to take my car to the shop for maintenance. I don’t need to 
memorize the air-filter size. I no longer worry that I’ve missed something. All those small details are right in the palm of my hand.
